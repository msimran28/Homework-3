1.  We cannot estimate the effect on police on crime directly because of
    the ‘reverse causality’ argument. Past researchers have found an
    increase in the crime rate affecting the number of police deployed.
    This makes the ‘police’ variable endogenous and therefore necessary
    to break the circle of reverse causality to estimate the desired
    causal effect. Furthermore, this reverse causality might exist in
    some cities and might not in the others due to structural
    differences. Hence, we cannot keep all the cities on the same scale
    to gauge.

2.  The researchers from UPenn formulated a model where the terror level
    in a city (Washington DC) on high alert days, directly affected the
    number of police deployed and if that directly affected the crime
    rate in the city. This broke the circle as crime rate did not have
    any direct effect on the terror level in a city, thereby stripping
    the ‘police’ variable of it’s endogeneity and isolating it. They
    decided to regress the crime rate on ‘high alert days’, a binary
    variable, in the first column and found it to significantly affect
    the crime rate at the 5% level. They explored the argument that high
    alert days reduced the number of people in the city, specifically
    tourists (victims of crime). If this were the case, it would then
    establish a direct effect of terror level on crime rate.
    Consequently, they regressed crime rate on ‘high alert days’ and the
    ‘log ridership in the metro’ on all days. They found that the effect
    of the terror level on the crime rate reduced to -6.05 from -7.32 ,
    but still statistically significant and ridership showed a
    significant effect at 1% implying a rise in the number of people
    present in the city increased crime by 1.7 (per day on average), an
    although very small number. The second regression also explained
    more variance in the crime rate by the two variables at 17% than
    just by one variable in the first regression model at 14%.

3.  They sought to explore the argument if high alert reduced the number
    of people, specifically tourists (victims of crime) since that would
    then establish a direct effect of terror level on crime rate and
    make the effect of police on the crime rate redundant to study. They
    therefore, regressed crime rate on ‘high alert days’ and controlled
    for ‘log ridership in the metro’ on all days. They found that the
    effect of the terror level on the crime rate reduced to -6.05 from
    -7.32 , maintaining the significance level at 5% and ridership
    showed a significant effect at 1% implying a rise in the number of
    people present in the city increased crime by 1.7 per day on
    average, an although very small number. The second regression also
    explained more variance in the crime rate by the two variables at
    17% than just by one variable in the first regression model at 14%.

4.  The model summarized in Column 1 minimizes the effect of the
    outliers in the data on the regression model that regresses crime
    rate on ‘high alert in District 1’, ‘high alert in the other
    districts’ and controls for ‘log ridership in the metro’ on all
    days. It estimates a higher significant impact on crime rate at 1%
    in case of a terror alert which could be the result of more police
    deployment in that area versus other districts where the effect is
    lower due to again maybe lesser police deployment. it looks like the
    researchers might be trying to gauge the structural differences
    within the city and gauge how the causal effect that they aim to
    find might not give a rather credible overall picture in the case of
    an uneven scale. Also, an interesting observation here is a
    considerable drop in the high alert coefficients from Table 2 and
    subsequently a rise in the log ridership number (though significant
    at 5% as opposed to 1% in Table 2). We don’t know if more variance
    is being explained here than in Table 2 though.
